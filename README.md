# Scrimba Solo Project: Unit Converter

This project is a part of Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path Course.

The aim of project is to create a unit converter app, that will allow to convert length, 
volume and mass units between metric and imperial system.

The design of the app was followed with the one provided in the course, with slight changes 
like colors and typography.

## Requirements for the task

* The app should include an input for user to change the converted number and automatically 
  recalculate values as it changes
* The values should be round up to 3 decimal places

## Changes history and description

1. Project setup - html file structuring, create index.css and index.js.
2. Styling - add the layout, manage white space, colors and typography.
3. Create conversion featrue - add the feature, without any limits to number of character.
4. Refactor the conversion feature and data - restructure data as object arrays, linking to DOM 
   elements through functions, more DRY code
5. Input display fix - set maximum and minimum range, prevent from typing in negative number, 
   prevent from re-rendering page while hitting "enter" in active input, fix google font link
   and html file doctype declaration 
6. Responsive and consistent display - add responsive display for smaller screens, make display
   of decimal points consistent for "0" input value

## Ideas for further development

1. Copying improvement feature for converted numbers
2. Possibility to convert unit of user's choice
